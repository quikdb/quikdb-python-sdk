QuikDB is a database leveraging blockchain technology for secure and efficient data management. This CLI tool, implemented in Python, provides commands for configuring, deploying, and managing QuikDB projects seamlessly.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later.
- **Pip**: Python's package manager.
- **Git**: For cloning repositories.

## Installation

1. **Install QuikDB CLI via pip**:
   ```bash
   pip install quikdb_clizAfsdazX YKL;
   "
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the CLI to manage QuikDB operations.

### 1. **View CLI Help**:
   To see the available commands and options:
   ```bash
   quikdb --help
   ```

### 2. **Install QuikDB**:
   Checks if QuikDB is installed and installs it if necessary:
   ```bash
   quikdb install
   ```

### 3. **Configure QuikDB**:
   Add configuration entries dynamically:
   ```bash
   quikdb config --username <USERNAME> --email <EMAIL> --identity <IDENTITY>

## Troubleshooting

### Resolving "Command Not Found" Issues:

1. **Verify Installation**:
   Check if `quikdb` is installed:
   ```bash
   pip show quikdb
   ```

2. **Ensure PATH is Updated**:
   Make sure the directory for global Python packages is in your `PATH`. You can find the directory using:
   ```bash
   python -m site --user-base
   ```
   Add the `bin` subdirectory of the above path to your `PATH` environment variable.

3. **Reinstall the Package**:
   If the issue persists, try reinstalling QuikDB:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall quikdb
   pip install quikdb
